      statement piece.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>How to Create Your Own Custom Hoodie: Step-by-Step</h2>
    <p>
      It is very easy to make a custom hoodie if you have the right tools for
      it. In the following tutorial, I'll let you know how you could easily
      design a hoodie with or without hoodie design templates by using a
      hoodie design maker.
    </p>

    <h4 style="color: lightgreen">
      <strong>Step 1: Selecting a Hoodie Design Maker or Platform</strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Select a design platform that works for you. Examples such as Amazon
      Custom Hoodies or Printful comes with intuitive design interfaces
      through which image uploads, text additions, and pre-made graphic
      selections are almost effortless.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color: lightgreen">
      <strong>Step 2: Design using a Hoodie Template </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Design templates will give you an easy ride when creating your designs.
      A hoodie template allows for a change of color, add or delete elements,
      and change layout without worrying about formatting anything.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color: lightgreen">
      <strong>Step 3: Print or Embroidery </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Printing will work well for bold and colorful designs. On the other
      hand, embroidery offers a soft, professional finish. Think of the
      purpose behind your design, once you have your final image, custom
      printed hoodies will be fantastic. Conversely, if you have a logo or
      monogram, then a custom embroidered hoodie would be excellent for that.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color: lightgreen"><strong>Step 4: Placement </strong></h4>
    <p>
      Place your design where it will draw attention. A hoodie with a design
      on the back has a great impact, and for subtle occasions, a simple front
      logo is awesome.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color: lightgreen">
      <strong>Step 5: Preview and Order </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Before ordering, preview your designs and make sure you are satisfied.
      Most websites feature a 3D mock-up showing you what the final result
      will look like.
    </p>
